# Mythra — NFT Ticketing & Community-Powered Crowdfunding on Solana

## 💫 What is Mythra?

Mythra is a Web3 platform built on Solana that redefines event creation and funding. We combine secure, anti-fraud NFT ticketing with transparent, DAO-governed crowdfunding.

By leveraging on-chain escrow and signature-based check-in, Mythra empowers organizers to launch trusted events and gives communities the tools to collectively fund and verify their success.

Create events, fund dreams, and attend with confidence — all in one ecosystem.

## 🧩 The Problem Mythra Solves

The traditional event and crowdfunding space is plagued with inefficiencies and a critical lack of trust:

- ❌ **High Upfront Costs:** Significant capital is required upfront, blocking smaller or new event creators.
- ❌ **Slow & Opaque Payments:** Organizers face delayed payouts and unclear financial flows from third-party platforms.
- ❌ **Ticket Fraud:** Static QR codes are easily duplicated, causing losses for organizers and fans.
- ❌ **Scam & Rug-pull Risk:** Fake organizers abuse crowdfunding and pre-sales, leading to lost funds and broken trust.

## ✅ Mythra as the Solution

Mythra tackles these core issues with a smart, transparent, and community-powered stack:

- ✅ **DAO-Governed Crowdfunding:** Funds are held in escrow and released only after community milestone approval.
- ✅ **Instant Smart Contract Payouts:** Ticket sales go directly to organizers; no manual delays.
- ✅ **Fully On-Chain & Transparent:** All sales, check-ins, and fund flows are publicly auditable.
- ✅ **NFT Ticketing:** Unique, non-duplicatable NFT tickets (1/1) minted on Solana.
- ✅ **Signature Check-in:** Prevents fraud by requiring a live wallet signature for entry.
- ✅ **Civic Auth Verification:** KYC for organizers enhances trust and reduces scam risk.

This creates a secure and seamless experience for organizers and a trustworthy, engaging platform for attendees and backers.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Organizer Registers & Verifies:** Completes KYC using Civic Auth.
2. **Event & Campaign Creation:** Organizer creates an event and/or a crowdfunding campaign on Mythra.
3. **Community Funding:** Supporters contribute SOL to the campaign, held in a smart contract escrow vault.
4. **NFT Ticket Sales:** Tickets are minted as NFTs and sold to attendees.
5. **Signature Check-in:** On event day, the attendee presents a QR code; the gate scanner prompts a wallet signature to verify authenticity.
6. **On-Chain Status Update:** The smart contract marks the NFT ticket as "Used."
7. **DAO Milestone Payout:** The DAO community votes to approve event milestones, triggering the release of crowdfunding funds from escrow to the organizer.
8. **Real-Time Dashboard:** All stats—sales, check-ins, funding progress, and DAO votes—are updated in real-time.
